# Password Generator

## About

This web site generates a random password based on criteria given by the user. The user responds to several questions such as length, whether to use numbers, symbols, lower case letters, etc., to fetch a random combination of elements to create a password. The main issue with the development process was creating a more efficient process. While the result was sucessful using several if statements, I used a for loop to clean up the coding, and reduce the number of lines. In the furure, I'd like to improve some of the readability, such as avoiding using generic numbers for the properties of the library and choice objects.

## Required 

This site is not functional unless the index.html, script.js and style.css files are not available.
